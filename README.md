# discord-signup-bot

This is a bot that handles trial/event signups for discord servers.
It was written for use in Elder Scrolls Online communities, but could
easily be used for other games and communities as well.

See [this website](https://www.evogames.org/bots/eso-signup-bot/) for some documentation
on using the bot.

## TODO

- signup channel restrictions
- announce grouping now (@everyone-targetted !show)
- working REPL (need to mock guild state to force admin)
